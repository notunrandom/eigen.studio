# Eigenstudio

Eigenstudio aims to explore new avenues in software development.

In mathematics, eigenvalues and eigenvectors feature prominently in the
analysis of linear transformations. They have a wide range of applications, for
example in stability analysis, atomic orbitals and artificial intelligence.

Code transformations will probably feature prominently in eigenstudio. More
generaly, eigenstudio aims to use mathematics for software development, or at
least be as cool for software development as eigenvalues are for mathematics.

The prefix eigen- is adopted from the German word eigen, meaning 'proper',
'characteristic', 'own'.

Eigenstudio is my own idea of proper software development, with characteristics
inspired by Extreme Programming and functional programming languages.
